- 👋 Hi, I’m @Indigo2000
- 👀 I’m studying for the MSc in Computer Science at the University of York as a way to get back into the IT sector. I'm currently a Maths teacher!
- 🌱 I used C/C++ in my previous roles before going into teaching but have covered Java, Python, Big Data, Cyber Security and AI (amongst others) on the course
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will get me back into work in the IT sector.
- 📫 Do get in touch.
