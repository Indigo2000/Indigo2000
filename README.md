- 👋 Hi, I’m @Indigo2000
- 👀 I’m interested in refreshing my coding skills after a career break with a desire to get back into the IT sector. I'm currently a Maths teacher!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (I used C/C++ in my previous roles before going into teaching).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will get me back into work in the IT sector.
- 📫 Do get in touch.
